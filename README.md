# Telephone and Conversation Transcriber

My elderly father is extremely deaf and struggles to hear people, particularly on the landline phone. So I built this — a Raspberry Pi with a 10" touchscreen that sits next to his phone and transcribes conversations in near real-time, so he can read what people are saying.

It picks up both phone calls (via a USB telephone recorder tapped into the landline) and in-room conversation (via a USB conference microphone), and displays live captions in large, clear text. When nobody's talking it shows a nice flip-clock. The whole thing runs headless as a systemd service — plug it in and it just works.

## Community

I originally built this just for my Dad, but after sharing it on Reddit ([r/raspberry_pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1r1ndvc/), [r/deaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1r1nf5u/)) the response was overwhelming. Hundreds of people reached out — many from the deaf and hard-of-hearing community — telling me how much something like this would help them or someone they love.

That response made me realise this could be genuinely useful to a lot of people, not just my Dad. So I'm now working on something new — a more polished, more accessible version designed from the ground up for the HoH community. Watch this space.

In the meantime, this project is fully open source and works well. If you build one, I'd love to hear about it — [open an issue](https://github.com/andygmassey/telephone-and-conversation-transcriber/issues) or reach out on Reddit.

## Easy Install

Got your Raspberry Pi set up with Raspberry Pi OS? Just run this one line:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andygmassey/telephone-and-conversation-transcriber/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open **http://gramps.local:8080** on your phone or computer. The setup page will walk you through the rest — picking your microphones and getting everything running. The whole thing takes about 5 minutes.

> **New to Raspberry Pi?** See the [step-by-step guide](docs/building-sd-image.md) for how to set up your Pi from scratch, including how to get WiFi working.

## What You'll Need

### The computer

Any Raspberry Pi from the list below will work, but which one you need depends on how you want to use it:

| Raspberry Pi | Cloud services | Offline (no internet) | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pi 5 (8 GB)** — recommended | Works great | Works great | ~$80 |
| **Pi 5 (4 GB)** | Works great | Works, but a bit slower | ~$60 |
| **Pi 4 (8 GB)** | Works great | Works, but noticeably slower | ~$55 |
| **Pi 4 (4 GB)** | Works great | Struggles — cloud recommended | ~$55 |
| **Pi 4 (2 GB)** | Works great | Not recommended | ~$45 |

**What's the difference?** When you use a cloud service (like Deepgram or Groq), most of the hard work happens on the internet, so even a cheaper Pi works fine. If you want it to work without internet, the Pi needs to do all the speech recognition itself, which needs more power.

**If you're buying new**, get the **Pi 5 with 8 GB** — it handles everything well and gives you the most flexibility.

You'll also need:

- **A USB-C power supply** for the Pi (~$12). Important: use the official Raspberry Pi power supply or one rated for 27W (5V/5A). Regular phone chargers don't provide enough power and cause problems.
- **A microSD card**, 32 GB or larger (~$8)

### The screen

Any HDMI touchscreen will work. I used a 10.1" screen (1280x800) that cost about $33. Bigger is better since the whole point is to read the captions easily.

### The room microphone

A **USB conference microphone** works best because it picks up sound from all directions — the person can sit anywhere nearby and it'll hear them. I used the [TONOR G11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GVGMW59) (~$30), which picks up voices clearly from about 3.5 metres away and plugs straight into the Pi with USB. Most USB conference microphones will work.

### The phone recorder (optional)

If you want to transcribe landline phone calls too, you'll need a **USB telephone recorder** that plugs into the phone line and the Pi. I used [this one from Taobao](https://intl.taobao.com/sk/_b.PbsIYe) (~$17) — search for "USB telephone recorder RJ-11" on Amazon or AliExpress for alternatives. It connects between the wall socket and the phone with a standard phone cable, so it hears both sides of the conversation. Most USB telephone recorders with an RJ-11 connection will work.

### Total cost

| Part | Approximate cost |
|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) | $80 |
| Official USB-C power supply | $12 |
| 32 GB microSD card | $8 |
| 10" HDMI touchscreen | $33 |
| USB conference microphone | $30 |
| USB phone recorder (optional) | $20 |
| **Total** | **~$163** (or ~$143 without phone recorder) |

## How Setup Works

You don't need to type anything on the touchscreen. Here's how it goes:

1. **Prepare the SD card on your computer** — you use a free app called [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to put the operating system on the SD card. During this step, you'll type in your WiFi name and password — this is the only time you need to enter them.
2. **Plug everything in** — put the SD card in the Pi, connect the screen, microphone(s), and power.
3. **Run the installer** — either plug in a keyboard or connect from another computer via SSH, and paste the one-line install command. It does everything automatically.
4. **Finish setup on your phone** — open **http://gramps.local:8080** in your phone's browser. The setup page will walk you through picking your microphones and choosing a speech service. No need to touch the Pi's screen at all.
5. **Done** — the touchscreen starts showing live captions. Plug it in and it just works from now on.

## Features

- **Live Captions** — words appear while the speaker is still talking, not after they stop
- **Speaker Turn Colouring** — colour and a `▸` marker change when the speaker changes (room mic, Deepgram)
- **7 Cloud Services** — Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Azure, Groq, Interfaze, OpenAI Whisper, Google Cloud
- **3 Offline Engines** — Faster Whisper, Vosk, Whisper.cpp — works even without internet
- **Dual Audio Sources** — transcribes both landline phone calls and in-room conversation
- **Flip-Clock Display** — split-flap style clock when idle, auto-dims at night
- **Touch Controls** — font size (S/M/L), colour schemes, drag-to-scroll history
- **Auto Phone Detection** — automatically switches to phone audio when a call begins
- **Bulletproof Reliability** — watchdog timers, auto-restart, health monitoring
- **Web Setup Wizard** — configure everything from your phone at `http://gramps.local:8080`

## Language Support

The transcriber is primarily built and tested with **English (British English)**, but most of the speech engines support many other languages. The setup wizard currently defaults to English — changing the language requires editing `caption_app.py` (we'd welcome a PR to add language selection to the wizard).

| Engine | Languages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Deepgram** | 36+ | Very good English, with support for Spanish, French, German, Hindi, and many more |
| **AssemblyAI** | 99+ | Wide language coverage |
| **Azure Speech** | 100+ | Excellent multilingual support |
| **Google Cloud** | 125+ | Widest language coverage |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | 50+ | Good multilingual support |
| **Groq** (Whisper) | 50+ | Same as OpenAI Whisper |
| **Interfaze** | Not tested | Likely multilingual — feedback welcome |
| **Faster Whisper** (offline) | 50+ | Same languages as Whisper |
| **Vosk** (offline) | 20+ | Needs a separate model download per language — see [Vosk models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) |
| **Whisper.cpp** (offline) | 50+ | Same languages as Whisper |

> **Non-English users:** If you try this in another language, we'd love to hear how it goes! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/andygmassey/telephone-and-conversation-transcriber/issues) to share your experience — it helps others.

## Cloud Services Compared

The setup wizard lets you choose from 7 different cloud speech services. Here's how they compare:

| Service | Speed | Free tier | Cost after free tier | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Deepgram** | Instant | $200 credit on signup | ~$0.004/min | Best all-round choice |
| **AssemblyAI** | Instant | 100 hours free | ~$0.006/min | Great accuracy |
| **Azure Speech** | Instant | 5 hours/month free forever | ~$0.01/min | If you already use Microsoft |
| **Groq** | Few seconds delay | Free (~8 hours/day) | Free | Free and very good |
| **Interfaze** | Few seconds delay | Pay as you go | ~$0.003–0.009/min | Low cost |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | Few seconds delay | Pay as you go | ~$0.006/min | If you already use OpenAI |
| **Google Cloud** | Few seconds delay | $300 new account credit | ~$0.006/min | If you already use Google |

**"Instant" vs "few seconds delay"** — The top three services show words on screen as they're being spoken, almost in real-time. The bottom four send audio in short batches, so words appear a few seconds after they're said. Both work well — it just depends whether you need to follow a fast conversation or are happy with a slight delay.

## Usage

### Display Modes

**Clock Mode (idle):** Split-flap style clock appears after 90 seconds of silence. Auto-dims between 22:00-07:00.

**Caption Mode (active):** Automatically switches when speech is detected.

### Touch Controls

- **S / M / L** — change font size
- **Colour circles** — switch colour scheme (white/black, black/white, yellow/black, green/black)
- **ONLINE / OFFLINE** — toggle between cloud and offline engines
- **Drag** — scroll through caption history
- **Escape** — exit application (if you've plugged in a keyboard)

### Phone Calls

When a landline call is detected via the USB phone recorder, the system automatically:
1. Switches to phone audio input
2. Shows a phone icon in the caption bar
3. Switches back to room mic after 10 seconds of silence

## Configuration

Normally the setup wizard writes the config for you and you never need to look at it. If you want to edit it by hand, copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and change what you need — every key is optional, and anything you leave out falls back to a built-in default (see `DEFAULTS` in `gramps_config.py`).

The config file is looked for in these places, in order — the first one that exists wins:

| Location | Use |
|---|---|
| `$GRAMPS_CONFIG` | Explicit path to a config file — overrides everything else |
| `<repo>/config.json` | Alongside the code, wherever you cloned it |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gramps-transcriber/config.json` | Standard Linux location (usually `~/.config/...`) |
| `~/gramps-transcriber/config.json` | Where the installer puts it |

On a Raspberry Pi set up with the installer, the checkout *is* `~/gramps-transcriber`, so the second and fourth entries are the same file — nothing changes for existing installs.

The other locations are there for running the transcriber somewhere other than a Pi. To test against a throwaway config without touching your real one:

```bash
GRAMPS_CONFIG=/path/to/test-config.json ~/gramps-env/bin/python caption_app.py
```

The app prints which config it loaded at startup. A missing, unreadable or malformed config file is never fatal — it logs the problem and carries on with defaults, so the device always comes up.

## Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer to set things up by hand, or the easy installer doesn't work for your setup:

### 1. Set up Python environment

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/gramps-env --system-site-packages
~/gramps-env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional, only if you use Azure Speech:
~/gramps-env/bin/pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
```

`--system-site-packages` is required — PyQt6 comes from apt (`python3-pyqt6`), not pip, so the venv has to be able to see it.

`requirements.txt` is a pinned lockfile generated from `pyproject.toml`. If you change a dependency, regenerate it:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --universal --python-version 3.11 -o requirements.txt
```

`--universal` matters: it resolves for every platform at once, so a lockfile compiled on an x86 laptop is still correct on an ARM Pi.

### 2. Download Vosk model (offline fallback)

```bash
cd ~
wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-gb-0.15.zip
unzip vosk-model-small-en-gb-0.15.zip
mv vosk-model-small-en-gb-0.15 vosk-uk
```

### 3. Configure credentials

```bash
cp credentials.py.example credentials.py
# Edit credentials.py with your API key
```

### 4. Install systemd services

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp systemd/caption.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp systemd/gramps-mute.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now caption gramps-mute
```

### 5. Install health monitor (recommended)

The caption monitor checks every 5 minutes that the transcriber is healthy — service running, audio capture alive, no restart loops, and logs aren't stale. It can optionally send alerts via Home Assistant or any webhook.

```bash
cp systemd/caption-monitor.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp systemd/caption-monitor.timer ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now caption-monitor.timer
```

### 6. Install system watchdogs (optional, requires root)

```bash
sudo cp scripts/caption-watchdog.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp scripts/display-watchdog.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp scripts/network-watchdog.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/*-watchdog.sh
sudo cp systemd/caption-watchdog.service systemd/caption-watchdog.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/display-watchdog.service systemd/display-watchdog.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/network-watchdog.service systemd/network-watchdog.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now caption-watchdog.timer display-watchdog.timer network-watchdog.timer
```

## Development

Running on a normal Linux machine rather than a Pi.

System libraries first — these aren't Python packages and no amount of pip or uv will supply them:

```bash
sudo apt install alsa-utils libportaudio2      # arecord/amixer, and sounddevice
```

Then either of two routes.

**Matching the appliance** (apt's Qt, same as the Pi — best fidelity for testing display behaviour):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 qt6-qpa-plugins python3-venv
python3 -m venv ~/gramps-env --system-site-packages
~/gramps-env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
~/gramps-env/bin/python caption_app.py
```

**With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** (isolated, no apt Python packages):

```bash
sudo apt install libgl1 libegl1 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-cursor0
uv run --extra gui caption_app.py
```

The `gui` extra pulls PyQt6 from PyPI, because `uv run` builds an isolated environment that can't see apt's copy. PyPI's Qt bundles Qt itself but still links against the system GL and xcb libraries above — without them you get `ImportError: libGL.so.1`. Most desktop installs already have them; minimal and headless ones don't.

**Don't install the `gui` extra on the appliance** — the Pi should keep apt's `python3-pyqt6`, which is wired to the platform plugins its touchscreen needs.

Put a `config.json` in the repo root (it's gitignored) and it will be picked up ahead of the installed one — see [Configuration](#configuration). To point at a throwaway config instead:

```bash
GRAMPS_CONFIG=/tmp/test.json uv run --extra gui caption_app.py
```

The caption display logic — interim results, finals, speaker turn changes — has tests that need no dependencies at all, not even PyQt:

```bash
./speaker-colour-statemachine-sim.py
```

It exits non-zero on failure. Run it before deploying anything that touches that state machine; it catches ordering bugs in seconds that would take an hour to reproduce in a live room.

## Troubleshooting

### No captions appearing

1. Check microphone levels:
   ```bash
   amixer -c 0 sget Mic  # Phone mic
   amixer -c 1 sget Mic  # Room mic
   ```

2. Check service status:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user status caption.service
   ```

3. Check audio devices are connected:
   ```bash
   arecord -l
   ```

4. Restart service:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart caption.service
   ```

### Service keeps crashing

```bash
journalctl --user -u caption.service -f
```

### Microphone recording silence

Check the mute button LED on the microphone:
- **LED ON** = Microphone active (working)
- **LED OFF** = Microphone muted (no audio)

Try unplugging and replugging the USB cable.

### Can't access the setup page

- Make sure you're on the same WiFi network as the Pi
- Try the Pi's IP address instead: `http://192.168.x.x:8080` (check your router for the Pi's address)
- Make sure the setup service is running: `systemctl --user status gramps-setup`

## Reliability Features

This is a device that sits next to an elderly person's phone — it needs to work every time, without anyone touching it. A lot of effort has gone into making it resilient to every failure mode we've encountered in real-world use.

### Application Level
- **Generation-based thread tracking** — each transcription session gets a unique generation number, so stale restart callbacks from old sessions are safely ignored
- **Sustained success pattern** — the restart counter only resets after 60 continuous seconds of receiving transcription text, preventing infinite restart loops
- **Subprocess health monitoring** — health checks verify the audio capture process (`arecord`) is actually alive, not just that the thread is running
- **Targeted subprocess management** — stops only the tracked audio process rather than using blanket process kills, preventing race conditions
- **Zombie process prevention** — proper subprocess reaping with `wait()` after every `kill()` to prevent defunct process accumulation
- **Automatic engine fallback** — switches from cloud to offline engine if the cloud service fails
- **Stale transcription detection** — restarts after 2 minutes of silence during an active session
- **Async phone switching** — phone on/off transitions happen asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI
- **Thread-safe state management** — all shared state protected by locks

### System Level
- **External health monitor** — `caption-monitor.sh` runs every 5 minutes via systemd timer, checking service status, restart loops, audio capture, and log staleness. Can send alerts via Home Assistant or any webhook
- **systemd watchdog integration** (Type=notify)
- **Display watchdog timer** — restarts the display manager if the screen goes blank, reboots if needed
- **Network watchdog timer** — pings the gateway every 2 minutes, restarts WiFi if connectivity is lost
- **LightDM aggressive restart policy**

## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
cd ~/gramps-transcriber
git pull
systemctl --user restart caption
```

Or just run the installer again — it's safe to run multiple times.
